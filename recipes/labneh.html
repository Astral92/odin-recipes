    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Labneh, pronounced “leb-nay,” is a savory yogurt cheese with Mediterranean roots. The word “labneh” comes from the Arabic word “laban,” meaning “white” or “milk.”</p>  
    <p>Also known as “labnah” or “labne,” it’s made by mixing yogurt with a little salt, then straining it to remove the whey. What’s left is a thick, creamy, and spreadable dip. It’s essentially an early phase of cheese, which is why we commonly refer to it as labneh cheese.</p>
